Q1 - Simply run `npm install && npm start`
      Now Head on to the browser and paste this URL in the address bar
       ```http://localhost:4200/```
     Currently the data is served from in-memory-web-api using HTTP Requests. This can be replaced with Real Endpoints easily.

Q2 - File `/src/server/bikesServer.js` holds the code. To run this code
      ```cd src/server && nodemon bikesServer.js```
      Now Head on to the browser and paste this URL in the address bar.
      ```http://localhost:8080/?count=20```
      Query parameter count describes the number of most popular responses you want to find. You can change this count parameter.
  * Dataset Location = ```/src/server/bikes.json```
  * Console output describes the most popular combination and their occurrence count.
  * Browser output describes the array of most popular combinations. Each element in this array is the combination of one or more bikes.

Q3 -  File `/src/server/priceServer.js` holds the code. To run this code
       ```cd src/server && nodemon priceServer.js```
       Now Head on to the browser and paste this URL in the address bar.
       ```http://localhost:8080/?count=3```
       Query parameter count describes the number of top prices you want to find. You can change this count parameter.
       Max Heap is implemented in this problem.
  * Dataset Location = ```/src/server/priceTimeStampDataset.json```
  * Console output shows the top prices.
  * Browser output describes the the top prices and timestamp records array.
